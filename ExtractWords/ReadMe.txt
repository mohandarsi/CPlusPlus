Simple solution for the problem described in  
https://www.fluentcpp.com/2020/04/17/how-to-extract-words-among-spaces-in-a-c-string/  

extracting words that are among spaces in a string.

For example, from the following string:
"word1    word2   word3  "

	
"word1    word2   word3  "

We’d like to extract 3 sub-strings: “word1”, “word2” and “word3”.
